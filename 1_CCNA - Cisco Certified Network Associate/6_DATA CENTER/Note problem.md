With VIRTUALIZATION TECHNOLOGY, SERVER need to communicate each others (EST-WEST TRAFFIC). 

Now global internet traffic is 80% EST-WEST

Classic configuration can do it (server -> toprack (access) switch -> distribution switch -> core switch -> distribution switch -> toprack (access) switch -> server)

BUT that is TOO MANY HOPS (6) for communication that has to happen CRAZY FAST

HOW DO WE FIX THIX ? 

Even with **Spanning Tree Protocol** and **Switching Loop**, Tier 3 Architecture DOESNT WORK
