A web application is like a “program” that we can use without installation as long as we have a modern standard web browser, such as Firefox, Safari, or Chrome. Consequently, instead of installing every program you need, you only need to browse the related page. The following are some examples of web applications:

- Webmail such as Tutanota, Protonmail, Outlook, and Gmail
- Online office suites such as Microsoft Office 365 (Word, Excel, and PowerPoint), Google Drive (Docs, Sheets, and Slides), and Zoho Office (Writer, Sheet, and Show)
- Online shopping such as Amazon.com, AliExpress, and Etsy

Thousands more examples provide a myriad of services. Other examples include online banking, money transfer, weather forecast, and social media.
