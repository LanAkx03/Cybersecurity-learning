**ETL** (Extract, Transfrom, Load)
- Exctrat data from different sources
- Transform the data
- Load the data into an other destination

	**ETL (****extract, transform, load)** is the “general procedure of copying data from one or more sources into a destination system which represents the data differently from the source” ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract,_transform,_load#:~:text=In%20computing%2C%20extract%2C%20transform%2C,than%20the%20source(s).)). That’s just a fancy way to say that ETL is the process of taking data from one place, massaging it a little, and saving it in another place.
