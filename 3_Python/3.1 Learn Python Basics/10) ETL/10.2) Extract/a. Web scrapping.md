There is a specific form of **ETL** called **Web Scraping**

**Web scraping** is the automated process of retrieving (or _scraping)_ data from a website. Instead of manually collecting data, you can write Python **scripts** (a fancy way of saying a code process) that can collect the data from a website and save it to a .txt or .csv file.

	Let’s say you’re a digital marketer, and you’re planning a campaign for a new type of blazer. It would be helpful to collect information like the price and description for similar blazers. Instead of manually searching and copy/pasting that information into a spreadsheet, you can write Python code to automatically collect data from the internet and save it to a CSV file.
	Throughout these next two chapters, I’ll be taking you step by step through a web scraping exercise. You’ll learn some cool new things _and_ get to practice some of the tools you’ve used already, like functions and variables. Make sure to follow along in your text editor. You’ll get much more out of this if you carry out the steps on your end along the way!
