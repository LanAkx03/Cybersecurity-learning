A **function** is a block of code with a specific purpose to which you give a name. When you **call** that function, you execute the code it contains. Functions also let you input **parameters** to run the same code on different values.  

There are different types of functions in Python:

1. Built-in functions provided with Python.
    
2. User-defined functions that programmers (that’s you!) create.
