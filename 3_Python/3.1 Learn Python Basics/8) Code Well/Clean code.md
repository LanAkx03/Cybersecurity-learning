The holy grail of coding standards is **DRY,** or **d**on’t **r**epeat **y**ourself. As a programmer, you want to make things as fast and efficient as possible and automate as much as you can. If you find yourself copying and pasting code a lot (or anything really), it’s usually a sign that you can automate the process.
