Comments are a great way to remind yourself and other developers what the code should be doing.

There are different standards for commenting - you want your code to be readable enough that you don’t need too many for someone to understand it.

Single line comments are denoted with  `#`  before and after. Below is an example of a single-line comment about a method.
