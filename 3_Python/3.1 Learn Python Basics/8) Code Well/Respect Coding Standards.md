In general, you read code much more often than you write it. That’s why it’s important to have guidelines to improve readability and make it as consistent as possible.

The official style guide for Python code is a document called [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/). It contains rules and best practices that help standardize how developers write Python.

More generally, the philosophies behind writing Python correctly are captured by a document called [PEP 20](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/): 

> _Explicit is better than implicit.  
> __Simple is better than complex.  
> __(...)  
> __READABILITY COUNTS._

It's vital to be familiar with this "Zen of Python," as it's called. I also recommend referring to PEP when new questions come up in your Python coding projects.
