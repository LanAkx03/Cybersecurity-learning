A) What is Inheritance?

One of the most useful things about object-oriented programming is the concept of **inheritance.** Inheritance allows you to create a **subclass** (or **child**) of a class that contains the **parent’s** attributes and **other attributes** specific to the child.

Here is an example of two classes: **Person** and **Employee.** Employee is a **subclass/child** of Person, and Person is a **superclass/parent** of Employee.

Notice that Walk() and Name are attributes of Person that are **inherited** by Employee, which also adds its own attributes: EmployeeID and Work().
